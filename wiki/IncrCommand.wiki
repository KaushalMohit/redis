_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Increment or decrement the number stored at _key_ by one. If the key does
 not exist or contains a value of a wrong type, set the key to the
 value of "0" before to perform the increment or decrement operation.

 INCRBY and DECRBY work just like INCR and DECR but instead to
 increment/decrement by 1 the increment/decrement is _integer_.

 INCR commands are limited to 64 bit signed integers.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], this commands will reply with the new value of _key_ after the increment or decrement.
