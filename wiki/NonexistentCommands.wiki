#summary A list of commands that don't exist in Redis, but can be accomplished in a different way.

This is a list of commands that don't exist in Redis, but can be accomplished in a different way, usually by means of [MultiExecCommand WATCH/MULTI/EXEC].

For better performance, you can pipeline multiple commands.

= SET with expire =

{{{
MULTI
SET foo bar
EXPIRE foo 1
EXEC
}}}

= HGETSET =

[GetsetCommand GETSET] for Hashes.

{{{
WATCH foo
old_value = HGET foo field
MULTI
HSET foo field new_value
EXEC
}}}

= ZADDNX =

Add an element to a sorted set, only if the element doesn't already exist (by default, [ZaddCommand ZADD] would update the element's score if it already exists). [http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/fc4c79d72e5bd346/6cdc07ecc36b81e7 See thread].

{{{
WATCH foo
score = ZSCORE foo bar
IF score != NIL
  MULTI
  ZADD foo 1 bar
  EXEC
ENDIF
}}}
