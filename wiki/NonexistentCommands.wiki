#summary A list of commands that don't exist in Redis, but can be accomplished in a different way.

This is a list of commands that don't exist in Redis, but can be accomplished in a different way, usually by means of `WATCH/MULTI/EXEC`.

For better performance, you can pipeline multiple commands.

= SET with expire =

{{{
MULTI
SET foo bar
EXPIRE foo 1
EXEC
}}}

= HGETSET - GETSET for Hashes =

{{{
WATCH foo
old_value = HGET foo field
MULTI
HSET foo field new_value
EXEC
}}}
