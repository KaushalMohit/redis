_Time complexity O(1)_

 Add the specified _member_ to the set value stored at _key_. If _member_
 is already a member of the set no operation is performed. If _key_
 does not exist a new set with the specified _member_ as sole member is
 crated. If the key exists but does not hold a set value an error is
 returned.

0 if the new element was already a member of the set
}}}
