=EXPIRE _key_ _seconds_=
=EXPIREAT _key_ _unixtime_ (Redis >= 1.1)=
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Set a timeout on the specified key. After the timeout the key will be
 automatically delete by the server. A key with an associated timeout is
 said to be _volatile_ in Redis terminology.

 Voltile keys are stored on disk like the other keys, the timeout is persistent
 too like all the other aspects of the dataset. Saving a dataset containing
 the dataset and stopping the server does not stop the flow of time as Redis
 registers on disk when the key will no longer be available as Unix time, and
 not the remaining seconds.

 EXPIREAT works exctly like EXPIRE but instead to get the number of seconds
 representing the Time To Live of the key as a second argument (that is a
 relative way of specifing the TTL), it takes an absolute one in the form of
 a UNIX timestamp (Number of seconds elapsed since 1 Gen 1970).

 EXPIREAT was introduced in order to implement [Persistence append only 
 saving mode] so that EXPIRE commands are automatically translated into 
 EXPIREAT commands for the append only file. Of course EXPIREAT can also
 used by programmers that need a way to simply specify that a given key 
 should expire at a given time in the future.

== How the expire is removed from a key ==

 When the key is set to a new value using the SET command, the INCR command
 or any other command that modify the value stored at key the timeout is
 removed from the key and the key becomes non volatile.

== Restrictions with write operations against volatile keys ==

 Write operations like LPUSH, LSET and every other command that has the
 effect of modifying the value stored at a volatile key have a special semantic:
 basically a volatile key is destroyed when it is target of a write operation.
 See for example the following usage pattern:

{{{
% ./redis-cli lpush mylist foobar /Users/antirez/hack/redis
OK
% ./redis-cli lpush mylist hello  /Users/antirez/hack/redis
OK
% ./redis-cli expire mylist 10000 /Users/antirez/hack/redis
1
% ./redis-cli lpush mylist newelement
OK
% ./redis-cli lrange mylist 0 -1  /Users/antirez/hack/redis
1. newelement
}}}

 What happened here is that lpush against the key with a timeout set deleted
 the key before to perform the operation. There is so a simple rule, write
 operations against volatile keys will destroy the key before to perform the
 operation. Why Redis uses this behavior? In order to retain an important
 property: a server that receives a given number of commands in the same
 sequence will end with the same dataset in memory. Without the delete-on-write
 semantic what happens is that the state of the server depends on the time
 of the commands to. This is not a desirable property in a distributed database
 that supports replication.

== Setting the timeout again on already volatile keys ==

 Trying to call EXPIRE against a key that already has an associated timeout
 will not change the timeout of the key, but will just return 0. If instead
 the key does not have a timeout associated the timeout will be set and EXPIRE
 will return 1.

== Enhanced Lazy Expiration algorithm ==

 Redis does not constantly monitor keys that are going to be expired.
 Keys are expired simply when some client tries to access a key, and
 the key is found to be timed out.

 Of course this is not enough as there are expired keys that will never
 be accessed again. This keys should be expired anyway, so once every
 second Redis test a few keys at random among keys with an  expire set.
 All the keys that are already expired are deleted from the keyspace. 

=== Version 1.0 ===

 Each time a fixed number of keys where tested (100 by default). So if
 you had a client setting keys with a very short expire faster than 100
 for second the memory continued to grow. When you stopped to insert
 new keys the memory started to be freed, 100 keys every second in the
 best conditions. Under a peak Redis continues to use more and more RAM
 even if most keys are expired in each sweep.

=== Version 1.1 ===

 Each time Redis:

  # Tests 100 random keys from expired keys set.
  # Deletes all the keys found expired.
  # If more than 25 keys were expired, it start again from 1.

 This is a trivial probabilistic algorithm, basically the assumption is
 that our sample is representative of the whole key space,
 and we continue to expire until the percentage of keys that are likely
 to be expired is under 25%

 This means that at any given moment the maximum amount of keys already
 expired that are using memory is at max equal to max setting operations 
 per second divided by 4.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically:

{{{
1: the timeout was set.
0: the timeout was not set since the key already has an associated timeout, or the key does not exist.
}}}
