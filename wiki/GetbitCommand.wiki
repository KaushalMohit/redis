= GETBIT _key_ _offset_ (Redis >= 2.1.8) =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Returns the bit value at _offset_ in the string value stored at _key_.

When _offset_ is beyond the string length, the string is assumed to be a contiguous space with 0 bits. When _key_ does not exist it is assumed to be an empty string, so _offset_ is always out of range and the value is also assumed to be a contiguous space with 0 bits.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically: the bit value stored at _offset_.
