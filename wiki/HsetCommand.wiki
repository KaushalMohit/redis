= HSET _key_ _field_ _value_ (Redis >= 1.3.10)=
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Set the specified hash _field_ to the specified _value_.

 If _key_ does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

 If the field already exists, and the HSET just produced an update of the
 value, 0 is returned, otherwise if a new field is created 1 is returned.

== Return value ==
