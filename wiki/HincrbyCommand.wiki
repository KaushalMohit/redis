= HINCRBY _key_ _field_ _value_ =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Increment the number stored at _field_ in the hash at _key_ by _value_. If _key_ does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created. If _field_ does not exist or holds a string, the value is set to 0 before applying the operation.

 The range of values supported by HINCRBY is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply] The new value at _field_ after the increment operation.
