=Retwis, a very simple Twitter clone using Redis as the only DB=

Retwis is a very simple Twitter clone. It uses only Redis as DB as a case study. Actually waht Retwis really is is the *Hello world of the Redis applications*. It was written using PHP in order to make the source code readable by everybody. Even the coding style is BASIC, no abstractions, just a plain web application, very fast, very raw, and easy to understand.

We run a [http://retwis.antirez.com Live demo of Retwis] so you can test it only. It's monkey asses fast! 6 milliseconds to generate a page in a very slow and loaded server, without any kind of caching, actually the implementation is to dump to reissue some query multiple times even if unneeded.

... article explaining the internals coming son, you can find the *source code* in [http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list the download section].
