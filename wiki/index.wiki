= Redis Documentation =

Hello! The followings are pointers to different parts of the Redis Documentation. This documentation is going to be split in more parts soon:

 * [README The README] is the best starting point, with a description of Redis features and commands.
 * [ProtocolSpecification The Protocol Specification] is all you need in order to implement a Redis client library for a missing language. PHP, Python, Ruby and Erlang are already supported.
 * [TwitterAlikeExample This is a tuturial about creating a Twitter clone using *only* Redis as database, no relational DB at all is used], it is a good start to understand the key-value database paradigm.
 * [FAQ Our FAQ] contains of course some answers to common questions about Redis.
 * [Benchmarks The benchmark page] is about the speed performances of Redis.
