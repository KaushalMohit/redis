= Redis Documentation =

Hello! The followings are pointers to different parts of the Redis Documentation. This documentation is going to be split in more parts soon:

 * [README The README] is the best starting point, with a description of Redis features and commands. Also the Protocol Specification is included in the README file. This file will be separated in different files in the near future.
 * [TwitterAlikeExample This is a tuturial about creating a Twitter clone using *only* Redis as database, no relational DB at all is used], it is a good start to understand the key-value database paradigm.
 * [FAQ Our FAQ] contains of course some answers to common questions about Redis.
 * [Benchmarks The benchmark page] is about the speed performances of Redis.
