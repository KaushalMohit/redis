= BRPOPLPUSH _key1_ ... _keyN_ _dstkey_ _timeout_ (Redis >= 2.1.8) =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Blocking version of the RPOPLPUSH command. Atomically removes and returns
 the last element (tail) of the first non-empty source list (with the same order as the
 arguments are given). When every source list is empty, the client blocks until
 another client pushes against one of the source lists. The element that is pushed is
 handled by the blocked client and is pushed to _dstkey_ and returned to the
 previously blocked client.
