_Time complexity O(N*M) worst case where N is the cardinality of the smallest set and M the number of sets_

 Return the members of a set resulting from the intersection of all the
 sets hold at the specified keys. Like in LRANGE the result is sent to
 the client as a multi-bulk reply (see the protocol specification for
 more information). If just a single key is specified, then this command
 produces the same result as SELEMENTS. Actually SELEMENTS is just syntax
 sugar for SINTERSECT.

 If at least one of the specified keys does not exist or does not hold
 a set value an error is returned.
