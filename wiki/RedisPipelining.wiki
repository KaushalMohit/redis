=What is pipelining=
Redis is a client-server TCP server using what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.

This means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:
 * The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.
 * The server processes the command and sends the response back to the server.
So for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:
 * *Client:* INCR X
 * *Server:* 1
 * *Client:* INCR X
 * *Server:* 2
 * *Client:* INCR X
 * *Server:* 3
 * *Client:* INCR X
 * *Server:* 4
