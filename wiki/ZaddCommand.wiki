= ZADD _key_ _score_ _member_ (Redis >= 1.1) =
_Time complexity O(log(N)) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set_

 Add the specified _member_ having the specifeid _score_ to the sorted
 set stored at _key_. If _member_ is already a member of the sorted set
 the score is updated, and the element reinserted in the right position to
 ensure sorting. If _key_ does not exist a new sorted set with the specified
 _member_ as sole member is crated. If the key exists but does not hold a
 sorted set value an error is returned.

 The score value can be the string representation of a double precision floating
 point number.

 For an introduction to sorted sets check the [RedisSortedSets Redis sorted sets] page.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically:

{{{
1 if the new element was added
0 if the element was already a member of the sorted set and the score was updated
}}}
