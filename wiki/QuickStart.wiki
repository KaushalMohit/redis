= Quick Start =

This quickstart is a five minutes howto on how to get started with Redis. For more information on Redis check [http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/index Redis Documentation Index].

== Obtain the latest version ==

The latest stable source distribution of Redis can be obtained [http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list at this location as a tarball].

{{{
$ wget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-1.02.tar.gz
}}}

The unstable source code, with more features but not ready for production, can be downloaded using git:

{{{
$ git clone git://github.com/antirez/redis.git
}}}

== Compile ==

Redis can be compiled in most [SupportedPlatforms POSIX systems]. To compile Redis just untar the tar.gz, enter the directly and type 'make'.

{{{
$ tar xvzf redis-1.02.tar.gz
$ cd redis-1.02
$ make
}}}

In order to test if the Redis server is working well in your computer make sure to run `make test` and check that all the tests are passed.

== Run the server ==

Redis can run just fine without a configuration file (when executed without a config file a standard configuration is used). To run Redis just type the following command:

{{{
$ ./redis-server
}}}

With the [Configuration default configuration] Redis will log to the standard output so you can check what happens. Later, you can [Configuration change the default settings].

== Play with the built in client ==

Redis ships with a command line client that is automatically compiled when you ran `make` and it is called `redis-cli`

For instance to set a key and read back the value use the following:

{{{
$ ./redis-cli set mykey somevalue
OK
$ ./redis-cli get mykey
somevalue
}}}

What about adding elements to a [Lists list]:

{{{
$ ./redis-cli lpush mylist firstvalue
OK
$ ./redis-cli lpush mylist secondvalue
OK
$ ./redis-cli lpush mylist thirdvalue
OK
$ ./redis-cli lrange mylist 0 -1
1. thirdvalue
2. secondvalue
3. firstvalue
$ ./redis-cli rpop mylist
firstvalue
$ ./redis-cli lrange mylist 0 -1
1. thirdvalue
2. secondvalue
}}}
