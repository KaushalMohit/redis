_Time complexity O(N) where N is the total number of elements in all the provided sets_

 Return the members of a set resulting from the union of all the
 sets hold at the specified keys. Like in LRANGE the result is sent to
 the client as a multi-bulk reply (see the protocol specification for
 more information). If just a single key is specified, then this command
 produces the same result as [SmembersCommand SMEMBERS].

 Non existing keys are considered like empty sets.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Multi bulk reply], specifically the list of common elements.
