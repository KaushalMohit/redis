= LRANGE _key_ _start_ _end_ =
_Time complexity: O(n) (with n being the length of the range)_

Return the specified elements of the list stored at the specified
key. Start and end are zero-based indexes. 0 is the first element
of the list (the list head), 1 the next element and so on.

For example LRANGE foobar 0 2 will return the first three elements
of the list.

_start_ and _end_ can also be negative numbers indicating offsets
from the end of the list. For example -1 is the last element of
the list, -2 the penultimate element and so on.

== Consistency with range functions in various programming languages ==

Note that if you have a list of numbers from 0 to 100, LRANGE 0 10 will return
11 elements, that is, rightmost item is included. This *may or may not* be consistent with
behavior of range-related functions in your programming language of choice (think Ruby's Range.new, Array#slice or Python's range() function).

LRANGE behavior is consistent with one of Tcl.

== Out-of-range indexes ==

Indexes out of range will not produce an error: if start is over
the end of the list, or start `>` end, an empty list is returned.
If end is over the end of the list Redis will threat it just like
the last element of the list.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Multi bulk reply], specifically a list of elements in the specified range.
