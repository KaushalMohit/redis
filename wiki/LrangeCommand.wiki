= LRANGE _key_ _start_ _end_ =
_Time complexity: O(n) (with n being the length of the range)_

 Return the specified elements of the list stored at the specified
 key. Start and end are zero-based indexes. 0 is the first element
 of the list (the list head), 1 the next element and so on.

 For example LRANGE foobar 0 2 will return the first three elements
 of the list.

 _start_ and _end_ can also be negative numbers indicating offsets
 from the end of the list. For example -1 is the last element of
 the list, -2 the penultimate element and so on.

 Indexes out of range will not produce an error: if start is over
 the end of the list, or start `>` end, an empty list is returned.
 If end is over the end of the list Redis will threat it just like
 the last element of the list.
