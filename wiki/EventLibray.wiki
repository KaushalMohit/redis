== Why is an Event Library needed at all? ==

Let us figure it out through a series of Q&As.

Q: What do you expect a network server to be doing all the time? <br/>
A: Watch for inbound connections on the port its listening and accept them.

Q: Calling [http://man.cx/accept%282%29 accept] yields a descriptor. What do I do with it?<br/>
A: Save the descriptor and do a non-blocking read/write operation on it.

Q: Why does the read/write have to be non-blocking?<br/>
A: If the file operation ( even a socket in Unix is a file ) is blocking how could the server for example accept other connection requests when its blocked in a file I/O operation.

Q: I guess I have to do many such non-blocking operations on the socket to see when it's ready. Am I right?<br/>
A: Yes. That is what an event library does for you. Now you get it.

Q: How do Event Libraries do what they do?<br/>
A: They use the operating system's [http://www.devshed.com/c/a/BrainDump/Linux-Files-and-the-Event-Poll-Interface/ polling] facility along with timers.

Q: So are there any open source event libraries that do what you just described? <br/>
A: Yes. Libevent and Libev are two such event libraries that I can recall off the top of my head.
