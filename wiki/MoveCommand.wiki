= MOVE _key_ _dbindex_ =
 Move the specified key from the currently selected DB to the specified
 destination DB. Note that this command returns 1 only if the key was
 successfully moved, and 0 if the target key was already there or if the
 source key was not found at all, so it is possible to use MOVE as a locking
 primitive.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically:

{{{
1 if the key was moved
0 if the key was not moved because already present on the target DB or was not found in the current DB.
}}}
