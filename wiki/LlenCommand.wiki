= LLEN _key_ =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Return the length of the list stored at the specified key. If the
 key does not exist zero is returned (the same behaviour as for
 empty lists). If the value stored at _key_ is not a list an error is returned.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically:

{{{
The length of the list as an integer `>=` 0 if the operation succeeded
-2 if the specified key does not hold a list value
}}}

Note that library clients should raise an error if -2 is returned by the Redis server instead to pass the negative value back to the caller.
