_Time complexity: O(log(N))+O(M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements returned by the command, so if M is constant (for instance you always ask for the first ten elements with LIMIT) you can consider it O(log(N))_

 Return the all the elements in the sorted set at key with a score between
 _min_ and _max_ (including elements with score equal to min or max).

 The elements having the same score are returned sorted lexicographically as
 ASCII strings (this follows from a property of Redis sorted sets and does not
 involve further computation).

 Using the optional LIMIT it's possible to get only a range of the matching
 elements in an SQL-alike way. Note that if _offset_ is large the commands
 needs to traverse the list for _offset_ elements and this adds up to the
 O(M) figure.

[ReplyTypes Multi bulk reply], specifically a list of elements in the specified score range.
