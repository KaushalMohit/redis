= ZRANGEBYSCORE _key_ _min_ _max_ =
_Time complexity: O(log(N))+O(M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements matching the min and max score_

 Return the all the elements in the sorted set at key with a score between
 _min_ and _max_ (including elements with score equal to min or max).

 The elements having the same score are returned sorted lexicographically as
 ASCII strings (this follows from a property of Redis sorted sets and does not
 involve further computation).

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Multi bulk reply], specifically a list of elements in the specified score range.
