=== PHP ===

==== Redis PHP Bindings ====

  * Simple default binding in Redis main repository.

==== Predis ====

  * A flexible and feature-complete PHP client library for the Redis key-value database. Predis is currently a work-in-progress and it targets PHP >= 5.3, though it is highly due to be backported to PHP >= 5.2.6 as soon as the public API and the internal design on the main branch will be considered stable enough.
