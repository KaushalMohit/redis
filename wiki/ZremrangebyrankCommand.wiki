= ZREMRANGEBYRANK _key_ _start_ _end_ (Redis >= 1.3.4) =
_Time complexity: O(log(N))+O(M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements removed by the operation_

 Remove all elements in the sorted set at _key_ with rank between _start_ and _end_. _Start_ and _end_ are 0-based with rank 0 being the element with the lowest score. Both_start_ and _end_ can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at the element with the highest rank. For example: -1 is the element with the highest score, -2 the element with the second highest score and so forth.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically the number of elements removed.
