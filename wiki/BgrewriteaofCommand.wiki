=== BGREWRITEAOF ===
  Please for detailed information about the Redis Append Only File check
  [AppendOnlyFileHowto the Append Only File Howto].

  BGREWRITEAOF rewrites the Append Only File in background when it gets too
  big. The Redis Append Only File is a Journal, so every operation modifying
  the dataset is logged in the Append Only File (and replayed at startup).
  This means that the Append Only File always grows. In order to rebuild
  its content the BGREWRITEAOF creates a new version of the append only file
  starting directly form the dataset in memory in order to guarantee the
  generation of the minimal number of commands needed to rebuild the database.

  The [AppendOnlyFileHowto Append Only File Howto] contains further details.
