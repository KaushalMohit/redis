 Return the set cardinality (number of elements). If the _key_ does not
 exist 0 is returned, like for empty sets. If the _key_ does not hold
 a set value -1 is returned. Client libraries should raise an error
 when -1 is returned instead to pass the value to the caller.

== Return value ==

[ReplyTypes Integer reply], specifically:

{{{
the cardinality (number of elements) of the set as an integer `>=` 0 if the operation succeeded
-2 if the specified key does not hold a set value
}}}
