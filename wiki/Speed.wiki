Redis takes the whole dataset in memory and [Persistence writes asynchronously to disk] in order to be very fast, you have the best of both worlds: hyper-speed and [Persistence persistence] for your data.

Establishing a new connection to a Redis Server is _simple_ and _fast_ nothing more that a TCP three way handshake. There is no authentication or other handshake involved ([http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/1adb93f0b6a1460a Google Group: Can we use connection pool in Redis?]) You can read more about the way Redis clients communicate with servers in the [ProtocolSpecification Protocol Specification].

On most commodity hardware it takes about 45 seconds to restore a 2 GB database, without fancy RAID. This can give you some kind of feeling about the order of magnitude of the time needed to load data when you restart the server, so restarting a server is fast too.

Also [Replication] is fast, benchamarks will give you the the same order of magnitude a restart does ([http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/3ab1c8b2126f1b8/29bdb6c5973f0388?lnk=gst&q=replication+#29bdb6c5973f0388 Google Group: Replication speed benchmak])
