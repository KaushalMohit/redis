= HSETNX _key_ _field_ _value_ =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 Set the specified hash _field_ to the specified _value_, if _field_ does not exist yet.
 If _key_ does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

 If the field already exists, this operation has no effect and returns 0.
 When the field didn't exist it is set to _value_ and returns 1.

== Return value ==
