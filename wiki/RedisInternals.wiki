== Redis STRINGS ==

String is the basic building block of Redis types. Redis is a key-value store.
All Redis keys are strings and its also the simplest value type. 
Lists, sets, sorted sets and hashes are other more complex value types and even
these are composed of strings.

Hacking Strings documents the Redis String implementation details.
