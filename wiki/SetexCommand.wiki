= SETEX _key_ _time_ _value_ =
_Time complexity: O(1)_

 The command is exactly equivalent to the following group of commands:
{{{
SET _key_ _value_
EXPIRE _key_ _time_
}}}
 The operation is atomic, but a [SetCommand SET}+[ExpireCommand EXPIRE] 
 operation was already provided
 usigng [MultiExecCommand MULTI/EXEC]. SETEX is a faster alternative provided
 since the operation is very common when Redis is used as a Cache.
